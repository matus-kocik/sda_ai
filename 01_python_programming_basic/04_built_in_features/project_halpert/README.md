# Project Mrs. Halpert (Python)

Your best friend's mom is a maths teacher and she asked you to write a program for her that executes simple mathematical operations.

## Tasks

### [ ] Even or odd

Develop a function called **even_or_odd** that takes an integer **number** as an argument and returns **Even** for even numbers or **Odd** for odd numbers.

1. [ ] The function should return the string **Even** or **Odd** depending on the number.

### [ ] Basic operations

Your task is to create a function called **basic_operations** that performs four basic mathematical operations. The function must accept the following arguments: an operation as a string (**'add'**, **'subtract'**, **'multiply'**, **'divide'**), **value1** as a number, and **value2** as a number.

1. [ ] The function returns the result of the operation applied to the two numbers.

### [ ] Total points

Write a function called **total_points** that calculates the total points a football team earns in a season. Each match result is a string in the format **x:y**, where **x** is our team's score and **y** is the opponent's score. The function should return the total points earned (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss).

1. [ ] The **total_points** function returns an integer representing the total points earned by the football team.

### [ ] The largest number

Create a function called **largest_number** that returns the largest number possible from three integers **a**, **b**, **c** using the operators +, *, and parentheses to form different combinations.

1. [ ] The **largest_number** function returns an integer representing the largest number obtained through calculations.

### [ ] Power of N-th

Implement a function named **index** that takes an array of positive numbers and a non-negative integer **number**. It should return the Nth power of the element in the array at the position **number**. If the **number** is outside the array's bounds, return -1.

1. [ ] The function returns the Nth power of the specified element or **-1** if the index is out of bounds.

### [ ] Quarter of the year

Construct a function named **quarter_of_the_year** that takes an integer **month** and returns which quarter of the year it falls into as an integer.

1. [ ] The function returns an integer indicating the quarter of the year.

### [ ] Century from year

Devise a function called **century** that accepts an integer **year** and returns the century it belongs to as an integer.

1. [ ] The function returns the century of the provided year as an integer.

### [ ] Form the minimum

Compose a function named **form_the_minimum** that takes an array of positive digits and returns the smallest number possible from those digits, using each digit only once.

1. [ ] The function returns the smallest number possible from the array.

## General requirements

- Make use of built-in functions wherever possible for efficiency.
