After learning manual calculation techniques, you're now ready to automate similar tasks using loops and conditionals, significantly reducing the amount of code you need to write.

Tasks
SHOW ALL CRITERIA
Average sales
Calculate the average sales income of the albums using a for loop.

The data.py file contains a variable named average_sale the value of which is the average sale of the eight albums.

A for loop performs the addition part of the calculation.

CRITERIA
Average age
Calculate the average age of the albums.

The data.py file contains a variable named average_age the value of which is the average age of the eight albums.

A for loop performs a part of the calculation.

CRITERIA
Newest and oldest albums
Identify the newest and oldest albums using for and if.

The data.py file contains a variable named newest_album the value of which is the most recently released album (object) from the best_selling_albums list.

A for loop and conditional statement inside perform a part of the calculation.

The data.py file contains a variable named oldest_album the value of which is the oldest album (object) released from the best_selling_albums list.

A for loop and conditional statement inside perform a part of the calculation.

CRITERIA
The albums of Eagles
Summarize the sales of the Eagles albums.

The data.py file contains a variable named albums_of_eagles which is an object.

One key in the object is named sales with a value being the sum of the sales of the two Eagles albums (using dot and bracket notations).

Another key in the object is named is_both_soft_rock with a boolean value. Two for loops check if both Eagles albums' genre lists contain the soft rock genre. If both do, is_both_soft_rock is true; otherwise, it's false.

CRITERIA
Do you like it?
Add a new key to each album. Use logical operators and if/else chains to assign values based on the artist and title. The value of the new key, i_like_it, depends on your preference, ensuring at least one album has a true value.

Every album in the best_selling_albums list includes an i_like_it key with a boolean value, reflecting personal preference. At least one album must have true as its value.

The new key is assigned using a single assignment operator within a conditional statement nested in a for loop, utilizing both bracket and dot notation.

CRITERIA


Hints
Combine conditions within if/else statements using logical operators (and, or) and create multiple conditions to set the i_like_it key's value based on both artist and title. Here's an example in Python syntax:

if something['first_key'] == "A" and something['second_key'] == "B":
    ...
elif something['first_key'] == "C" and something['second_key'] == "D":
    ...
elif something['first_key'] == "F" or something['second_key'] == "E":
    ...
Focus on mastering for and while loops as they are fundamental in Python for iterating through data. Other iteration methods like list comprehensions or the map and filter functions will be covered later.
