# What if (Python)

### This is a guided project

To learn the most, try and implement it on your own first, and check the solution only when you feel necessary. However, if you feel completely stuck, feel free to check the step-by-step solution guide

Now that you are familiar with the basics of algorithms, time to practice them on larger set of data.

## Tasks

### [√] List of movies

In a previous project, you created a list of your four favorite movies. Copy that list into the **data.py** file in this project's repository.

1. [√] The **data.py** file contains a variable named **fav_movies** which holds a list derived from the 'My Top 4 Movies' project.

### [√] The for loop

Use a **for** loop and print function to display all the movie titles in the terminal.

1. [√] All movie titles are displayed in the terminal using a **for** loop and the print function.

### [√] The while loop

Perform the same task with a **while** loop.

1. [√] All movie titles are displayed in the terminal using a **while** loop and the print function.

### [√] Average rate

Calculate the average rating using a loop. Create a **total_rate** variable outside the loop with a starting value of **0**. Add each movie's rating to this variable within the loop. After the loop, calculate the average rating.

1. [√] An **average_rate** variable exists, calculated as the average rating of the movies. The summing occurs inside the loop, and the average is computed outside the loop.

2. [√] The average rating is printed to the terminal.

### [√] Newest movie

Identify the newest movie by combining a **for** loop with an **if/else** statement. Initialize a **newest_movie** variable with the first movie object, then update it as you find newer movies. Print the newest movie's title after the loop.

1. [√] A **newest_movie** variable exists that holds the newest movie object after the loop.

2. [√] The title of the newest movie is printed to the terminal.

### [√] Combined loops

Combine loops to log all movie stars. Initialize a **stars_by_movies** variable as an empty string. Use nested loops to concatenate movie titles and their stars to this variable, separating entries with line breaks.

1. [√] A **stars_by_movies** variable contains a concatenated string of movie titles and stars.

2. [√] The **stars_by_movies** variable's content is printed to the terminal.

## Hints

- Focus on mastering **for** and **while** loops for iterating through data. While Python offers various methods for iteration such as list comprehensions and the **map**, **filter**, and **reduce** functions, understanding the basics is essential before moving on to more complex techniques.

- Remember to revisit previous projects if you need a refresher on the tasks or to review your previous solutions for insights and inspiration.
