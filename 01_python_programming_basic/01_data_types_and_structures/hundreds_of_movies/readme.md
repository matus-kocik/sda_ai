# Hundreds of movies (Python)

Your friend has a database of his/her favorite movies, which is already structured as a list of Python dictionaries. Some data pieces are missing, and your task is to complete the database without altering the original movies list directly. Instead, add your corrections to a separate Python file, corrections.py, referencing the details for the movies from IMDB.

### Hints

- Make your corrections in a separate Python file, corrections.py, without altering the original movies list in data.py.
- Recall techniques from previous projects for manipulating lists and dictionaries in Python.
- Test your code as you progress. Python's interactive mode or running the corrections.py script can help validate your updates.
- Remember, the assignment (=) operator in Python is used for setting values, and you can directly add or update dictionary keys and values.
