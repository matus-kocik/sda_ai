In this project, you will work with an existing data structure: the eight best-selling albums of all time. Unlike before, this data is represented as a list with dictionaries in Python. The tasks have been slightly modified to suit this context.

Tasks
SHOW ALL CRITERIA
Calculate average sales income
Calculate the average sales income of the albums. Assign this calculation to a new variable named average_sale.

The data.py file contains a variable named average_sale whose value is the calculation of the average sale of the eight albums.

CRITERIA
Calculate average age
Calculate the average age of the albums. First, store the current year in a variable named current_year, then calculate the average age and assign it to another variable called average_age.

The data.py file contains a variable named average_age whose value is the calculation of the average age of the eight albums.

CRITERIA
Newest and oldest album
Create a variable named newest_album and assign the most recently released album (dictionary) as its value. Create another variable named oldest_album and assign the oldest album to it.

The data.py file contains a variable named newest_album whose value is the most recently released album dictionary from the best_selling_albums list.

The data.py file contains a variable named oldest_album whose value is the oldest released album dictionary from the best_selling_albums list.

CRITERIA
Albums of Eagles
The band Eagles has two albums on the list. Create a new variable albums_eagles as a dictionary. Then add a sales key with the sum of the sales of the two albums. Add another key named is_both_soft_rock, and set its value to true by comparing the "soft rock" genres of both albums.

The data.py file contains a variable named albums_eagles whose value is a dictionary.

One key of the dictionary is sales, with its value being the sum of the sales of the two Eagles albums.

Another key of the dictionary is is_both_soft_rock whose value is true if both Eagles albums are classified under "soft rock" genre.

CRITERIA
Add an extra album
Find another album of your choice, collect similar data as the albums in the best_selling_albums list. Make a dictionary out of it and set it as the value of the ninth item in the best_selling_albums list.

The best_selling_albums list has a ninth item which is a dictionary containing the same keys as the others. The ninth item is added using the assignment operator and list indexing.

CRITERIA
Like it or not
Add a new i_like_it key to each album dictionary with a boolean value: true if you like the album and false if you do not.

Each album dictionary in the best_selling_albums list contains an i_like_it key with a boolean value. The new key is added using the assignment operator, list indexing, and dictionary key assignment.

CRITERIA


Hints
The data structure you'll be working with (best_selling_albums) should be in the data.py file.

The single equals sign (=) in Python is used for assignment, not comparison. For comparing equality, Python uses double equals sign (==).

In Python, comparisons result in boolean values (True or False). You can directly assign this result to a variable.

Remember to use Python's list and dictionary syntax for accessing and modifying data.

As with previous projects, ensure accuracy in your implementation. If you encounter difficulties, don't hesitate to seek help or refer back to the materials from previous projects for guidance.
