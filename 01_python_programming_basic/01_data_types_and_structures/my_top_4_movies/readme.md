# My top 4 movies (Python)


### This is a guided project
To learn the most, try and implement it on your own first, and check the solution only when you feel necessary. However, if you feel completely stuck, feel free to check the step-by-step solution guide

### Welcome to Your Python Coding Journey!
In this project, you'll use everything you know about different data types and structures, logic, conditional expressions, and loops. Understanding these core concepts is crucial for effective programming and problem-solving.

**Data Types and Structures:** Learn how to work with primitives like integers and strings, collections like lists and dictionaries, and nested structures.
**Logic and Conditional Expressions:** Master the art of making decisions in your code using if, elif, and else statements.
**Loops:** Get comfortable with for and while loops to automate repetitive tasks.
You're already equipped with the skills to create and manipulate complex data structures, implement logic to control the flow of your programs and utilize loops for efficient coding. Get ready to enhance your programming capabilities and tackle real-world challenges with confidence!

Let's get started on this exciting coding adventure!

## Tasks

### [x] Create favorite movies list

Choose your four favorite movies, and collect the following information about them: title, year of release, IMDB rating, and short description. Create a favourite_movies variable as a list of four dictionaries (representing the movies), and add the movie details to the dictionaries using the title, year, rating, and description keys.

1. [x] The data.py file contains a variable named favourite_movies. The value of the variable is a list which contains four dictionaries.
2. [x] All dictionaries in the list include the following keys, based on the movie data: title, year, rating, description.

### [x] Present some data

Display the following pieces of data in the terminal when running the data.py file: title of the first movie, year of the second movie, rating of the third movie, and the description of the fourth movie.

1. [x] The title of the first movie is displayed in the terminal when the data.py file is run.
2. [x] The year of the second movie is displayed in the terminal when the data.py file is run.
3. [x] The rating of the third movie is displayed in the terminal when the data.py file is run.
4. [x] The description of the fourth movie is displayed in the terminal when the data.py file is run.

### [x] Present some context

Extend the previously displayed data fields by adding a string before each field.

1. [x] The title of the first movie is preceded by the text "The title of the first movie is: " when data.py is run in the terminal.
2. [x] The year of the second movie is preceded by the text "The release year of the second movie is: " when data.py is run in the terminal.
3. [x] The rating of the third movie is preceded by the text "The IMDB rating of the third movie is: " when data.py is run in the terminal.
4. [x] The description of the fourth movie is preceded by the text "The short description of the fourth movie is: " when data.py is run in the terminal.

### [x] Include more data

Extend the movie dictionaries with more data. Collect the director(s), writer(s), stars, and genres of the movies, and add them to the dictionaries as lists (even if a movie has only one director or writer). Use the following keys: directors, writers, actors, and genres.

1. [x] All dictionaries in the favourite_movies list include the directors, writers, actors, and genres keys.
2. [x] All values of the newly-defined keys are of type list.

### [x] Present some new data

Present the first director of the first movie, the first writer of the second movie, the first star of the third movie, and the first genre of the fourth movie.

1. [x] The first director of the first movie is preceded by the text "The lead director of the first movie is: " when data.py is run in the terminal.
2. [x] The first writer of the second movie is preceded by the text "The lead writer of the second movie is: " when data.py is run in the terminal.
3. [x] The first star of the third movie is preceded by the text "The lead star of the third movie is: " when data.py is run in the terminal.
4. [x] The first genre of the fourth movie is preceded by the text "The main genre of the fourth movie is: " when data.py is run in the terminal.

### [x] Calculate the average rating of the movies

Calculate the average rating of the movies and save it to a new variable named average_rating.

1. [x] The data.py file contains a variable named averageRating the value of which is the calculated average rating of the four movies.

### [x] Calculate the average age of the movies

Calculate the average age of the movies and save it to a new variable named average_age. Calculate the age of each movie based on the release year before evaluating the average value.

1. [x] The data.py file contains a variable named average_age, which is the average age of the four movies.

### Hints

- In Python, you can concatenate strings using the plus sign (+). For example, "this text " + "and another text" results in "this text and another text". You can also format strings using f-strings for easier variable integration: f"This is {variable}".
- For calculations and data manipulations, rely on standard mathematical operations. Python supports these directly in expressions.
- Use parentheses () to control the order of operations in mathematical expressions.
- The outcome of this project will be utilized in subsequent projects. Ensure accuracy and thoroughness. If you encounter difficulties, consider seeking mentor assistance or consulting the documentation.
